Problem 1:

Hello Professor, Not exactly sure what homework three entails. However, I will give it a shot.
type: crontab -e

Then add the follwoing string of code 
For example, this will execute a script every day at 9:00AM

* * * * * /path/to/command arg1 arg2

0 9 * * * /home/MyUser/MyCrons/myScript.sh

Now to make this script run from a particular user, edit the following:

crontab -l -u USERNAME (USERNAME HERE OF THE PERSON YOU ARE TRYING CYBER ATTACK)


Problem 2: 

I Believe we already Clond and submit pull requests. I'm currently reading the Git Book, THERE IS ALOT TO COVER!
WOW!
